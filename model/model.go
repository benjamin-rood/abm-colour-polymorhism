Timeframe holds the model's representation of the time metrics.
Turn ‚Äì The cycle length for all agents ‚àà ùêÑ to perform 1 (and only 1) Action.
Phase ‚Äì Division of a Turn, between agent sets, environmental effects/factors,
				and updates to populations and model conditions (via external).
				One Phase is complete when all members of a set have performed an Action
				or all requirements for the model's continuation have been fulfilled.
Action ‚Äì An individual 'step' in the model. All Actions have a cost:
				the period (number of turns) before that specific Action can be
				performed again. For most actions this is zero.
				Some Actions could also *stop* any other behaviour by that agent
				for a period.

Environment specifies the boundary / dimensions of the working model. They
extend in both positive and negative directions, oriented at the center. Setting

most cases, a 2D environment will be sufficient.
In the future it may include some environmental factors etc.
