## Model Requirements ##

A Predator-Prey Agent-Based Model of prey colour polymorphism (CP).

Two agent populations: **Visual Predators** (VP) and **Colour-Polymorphic Prey** (CPP).

Visualisation in "Live" viewport

Interactive control via GUI controls, setting constant value parameters which are received and then used to either update or restart model.

Modularity â€“ Features determined by Dale.


### Initial Development Target ###

Assume **Environment** (E) is STATIC. 
E = Perfect 2D world that agents 'live' in. 
No environmental factors.
No ageing. All agents perfect (constant) health

**Visual Predators** (VP) STATIC. No variation, no death, no reproduction.
VP competitive, non-grouping.
Model simplistic process of visual identification of prey agents, based on distance from VP, colour difference from background environment, and colour distance from VP's imprinted bias towards its "image" of a prey agent.

**Colour-Polymorphic Prey** (CPP) GENUINE POPULATION. Variation, reproduction, mutation.
CPP 'death' from consumption by VP.
Assume food omnipresent in E for CPP.
Variations and Mutations reflected individual agent Colouring.
