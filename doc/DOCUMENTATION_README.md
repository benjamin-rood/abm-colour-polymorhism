>Note that all pseudo-code in algorithms described in this folder use the formal definition of an operator: e.g.  =  means equality *not* assignment. 
Instead, use ⟵ operator to represent value assignment / copy, e.g. `a ⟵ b` means read the value from `b` and give that value to `a`.

`rbb_*` documents define the rule set for an agent type `*` as a simplistic algorithm. At the moment they are all missing a "birth" or "init" conditions, which I will remedy today.
