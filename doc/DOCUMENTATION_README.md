>Note that all pseudo-code in algorithms described in this folder use the formal definition of an operator: e.g.  =  means equality *not* assignment. 
Instead, use ⟵ operator to represent value assignment / copy, e.g. `a ⟵ b` means read the value from `b` and give that value to `a`.

`rbb_*` documents define the rule set for an agent type `*` as a simplistic algorithm.

See `agent-types` as a conceptual sketch document rather than code, because I completely misunderstood interfaces when I sketched that out. Useful exercise, but totally wrong as far as being related to Go code!
