(My apologies in advance for any confusing terms, please excuse my stumbling through what I am trying to ask:)

I am trying to figure out if it is possible to determine (derive?) the equation of a specific set of graphs with the following shared constraints for all graphs:

The axis of symmetry is:  $\ \ x = 0 \ \therefore \ f(-x) = f(x)$

$f(x) > 0\ ,\ \forall \ x$

The integral of all functions over the interval $\ -1 \leq x \leq +1$ is a given constant,$\ c$

$\forall \ x \neq 0 \ , \ f'(x) $ is increasing / concave upwards, except for the equation $f(x) = c$

$f'(0) = 0$ for all cases.

The value at $f(0)$ is also always known/given.

I've done a couple of quick sketches for two example graphs which try to represent what I am going for below. The shaded area under both of the graphs in $[-1, 1] = 2 = c $

We treat the top sketch as a baseline reference â€“ the equation for this graph is obviously $f(x) = c = 2.$ But what if we didn't have a sketch, what if the only two things we knew were that $f(0) = 2$ and the area of the graph, $c = 2?$

The bottom sketch shows the graph of a function with area $\ c = 2\ $ , $f(0) = 9$ , where:
$f'(0) = 0$
$f'(x) > 0 \ ,\forall x \neq 0$

Is that enough information to get the functions? If so, how do I 'acquire' it?
